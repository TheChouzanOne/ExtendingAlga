# Extending Alga
Repository/Blog where I will be uploading/posting [alga](https://github.com/snowleopard/alga) related work, to try and extend its capabilities with common weighted graph algorithms and come up with a typesafe representation for acyclic graphs.

I will try to post all my learning process, interesting stuff I find, problems that I've solved to understand haskell or to understand the structure of alga.
