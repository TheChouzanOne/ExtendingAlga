# Introduction

The objective of these posts are to share [alga](https://github.com/snowleopard/alga) and make it easier for newcomers. I'll do my best as I am a newcomer as well, not only on this library but haskell in general. I first heard about it on Seven Languages in Seven Weeks and has been in my interest languages list for a long time. Now was the proper time to take it out of there as one of the projects for [GSoC 2019](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) consists of improving this library by adding some famous algorithms for weighted graphs and coming up with a typesafe representation for acyclic graphs. Thus, I will focus on the Labelled module of the library (and maybe come up with a new module called acyclic?).

Also, this is the first time I write a blog so, bear with me. The quality of posts will get better over time.
